# Project Boilerplate

I thought it would be a good idea for me to create a personalized boilerplate for projects. Based on the idea of CodePen and CodeSandbox where I could just start writing my own code without a lot of setup. I also wanted it to be easily updated. 

So here we are. There's some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I like for most projects. Things like:
* css variables for colors and fonts
* branded colors and fonts
* prefers light or dark theme 
* my own main.css file that overwrites the normalize and HTML5-Boilerplate css - so much neater
* a copyright with JS to update the year, a link to my portfolio, and my logo
* a setup for Flexbox so I can plug my content into the structure I've set up, set some widths, and the layout is automatic

There are a few things I may add
* sample pages with a nav and other design systems that I like
* soft scroll and scroll to top icon
* bottom nav for mobile

For me the key will be to add enough that it's helpful but not so much that it's difficult to sort through. I'm also planning on making coding samplers for design systems. 

What do you think of making up your own? üôÇ
